# COP3223
COP 3223 - Introduction to C Programming

## Project Summary
This Othello project, developed as part of the COP 3223 course: Introduction to Programming with C, demonstrates a complete implementation of the classic board game Othello. The project is organized into six assignments, each building upon the previous one. Starting with the basic board setup, the subsequent assignments introduce gameplay mechanics, valid move checks, flipping pieces, end game conditions, and culminate in a fully functional game that allows two players to compete against each other. The code is structured for clarity and modularity, showcasing fundamental programming concepts in C, including function prototypes, arrays, and control structures.
